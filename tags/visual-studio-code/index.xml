      <description>Introduction This project exists thanks to the incredible generosity of a tremendous number of people.
It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible to thank everyone who contributed. Acknowledgements are always incomplete.
Yet we want to make the attempt to express our gratitude.
Scope This project (in its current form) is now one year old.
We want to acknowledge the contributions of various companies, organizations, and groups that helped it reach this point.
While we might desire to be more granualar in our approbation, it would be both impractical in scope and imbalanced in outcome.</description>

      <description>Learning Path for Visual Studio Code Step 1: Getting Started with Visual Studio Code Perhaps the best place to start learning about Visual Studio Code is the introduction to VS Code by James Q Quick. It also provides an introduction to Visual Studio Code Extensions as well as Emmet.
Then to get a refresher and a slightly different view, watch Getting started with Visual Studio Code and Get started with VS Code Extensions by the VS Code team.</description>
