      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In the second site design of this project we incorporated the Minimal Hugo theme, which offers one place for articles.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll modify the theme to create a new third site design that adds an additional category to display content for a separate topic.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project exists thanks to the incredible generosity of a tremendous number of people.
It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible to thank everyone who contributed. Acknowledgements are always incomplete.
Yet we want to make the attempt to express our gratitude.
Scope This project (in its current form) is now one year old.
We want to acknowledge the contributions of various companies, organizations, and groups that helped it reach this point.
While we might desire to be more granualar in our approbation, it would be both impractical in scope and imbalanced in outcome.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In two previous posts we added a last modified date to post pages and to list pages in Hugo. But the logic used to determine if the last modified date should be displayed was flawed.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll fix that logic to correctly determine when to display the last modified date.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
In all our previous posts we worked with Git locally.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at using Git to work with remote repositories.
What is a remote repository? According to the &amp;ldquo;Git Basics - Working with Remotes&amp;rdquo; section from Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub:
 Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.</description>

In the previous post we looked at how to start working with Git as simply as possible. We did that by focusing on only Git, working with it only locally, and using only the most basic commands.
After installing and setting up Git, the commands we looked at were those for establishing a Git repository and completing the Version Control Cycle.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
Git and GitHub are two related but separate tools that are helpful for software development, as well as many other things.
They are both flexible and powerful, which makes them very useful.
But that flexibility and power come from some complex features and interactions that can also make them seem intimidating at first. They do not need to be intimitidating, however.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the start of a series on Git and GitHub.
There are many uses for Git and GitHub so there&amp;rsquo;s isn&amp;rsquo;t one right path for learning about them. Some users will utilize one set of features, while another group of users may focus on a fairly different set of features. Consequently, an efficient path for learning about Git and GitHub will depend on what you want to do with those tools and how you intend to use them.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In a previous post we updated the list template so that it worked as intended for all sections and subsections.
The terms template, however, which generates pages like the tags page, used redundant code that still reflected the original interface.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll create a new list-page partial template file with the code from the previously updated list template.</description>

      <description>Introduction When testing changes to CSS it can sometimes appear that nothing is happening.
That can be caused by many issues, but one issue that can be tricky to detect is when the browser is caching old CSS after a reload of the page.
Even after the page is refreshed and the HTML content is updated, the old CSS styling can still linger. That can be particularly frustrating and confusing. If the page has refreshed, why hasn&amp;rsquo;t the styling updated?</description>

The Problem When clicking on-page links the top of the content is covered by the site&amp;rsquo;s fixed header.
We want linked content to display just below the fixed header.
The Process This is a common problem with a long history, so a web search quickly led to some helpful discussions of the issue:</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/adding-sequence-ids-to-hugo-post-filenames/</guid>
      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Currently, when new posts are created with the hugo new &amp;lt;file_name&amp;gt; command, a new file is created named with the file_name parameter passed to the command. With the help of the post archetype file, that filename is also used to create the post title.
That approach is fine for a small number of posts, but as the number of posts grows it becomes harder to find a specific post when looking, because files are sorted alphabetically by filename, which isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful in many cases.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/fixing-site-link-errors-between-subdomains-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>The Problem Because of the design decision to build the website files for sites hosted on two subdomains within the same Hugo project there were several adjustments that had to be made.
One issue was that within a given subdomain links could be expressed as a relative path (/about/ or /post/, for instance), but across different subdomains that didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Specifically, on the page subdomain those links would point to page.</description>

This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll override the CSS styling for certain HTML elements.

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Consequently, nearly all design choices were initially made by the theme&amp;rsquo;s creator.
Naturally, when selecting a theme, you choose the one that best meets your goals. And the Minimal theme was chosen because it is clean and well-written.
But no theme is likely to match your project&amp;rsquo;s needs in every detail. As Zachary Wade Betz puts it:</description>

In this post, after resolving the problem of Changing the Size of Font Awesome Icons in Hugo, we now want to increase the spacing between the arrow icons used for page navigation icons on list pages.
The Process From the previous investigation mentioned above we know that the arrow icons are defined in the fa-arrow-left and fa-arrow-right elements of the paginator.</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at changing the page navigation icons on list pages. For our purposes, the arrows used at the bottom of each list page are too small, making them difficult to click.
The Process As has been mentioned before, because Hugo offers so much flexibility and produces pages in such a layered way, it can be difficult to find the right place to make the necessary alterations.</description>

      <description>The Problem When posting snippets of regular expression code inside code blocks (as in this example) it would be helpful to apply syntax highlighting.
Because this site uses Hugo, which uses Chroma, which does not yet include support for highlighting regular expressions another approach is required.
The Process A web search for regular expression syntax highlighting returned some discussions of the general question:
 Is there a good syntax highlighting hint for regular expressions?</description>

      <description>The Problem When authoring articles using Markdown that include Markdown special characters in the content, questions can come up about how to escape those special characters.
For instance, this article about updating Hugo posts with code syntax highlighting includes Markdown code fences within code fences, which required figuring out how to escape code fences within code fences.
The Process A web search quickly led to this helpful article, which explained the options for escaping code fencing.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
After working with Hugo for a while you might find that there are certain pieces of code that you include in every project.
Once you tire of manually copying and pasting them, it&amp;rsquo;s time to figure out which template file to alter to automatically include those snippets.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Hugo Post Creation with a Bash Script</title>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/simplifying-hugo-post-creation-with-a-bash-script/</guid>
      <description>Background Creating new posts in Hugo is already pretty simple thanks to the post creation command, but it can help to remove even little bits of friction.
Two points of friction in the current process are:
 navigating to the project directory, and properly formatting the new file name by remembering to name the file with dashes (-) instead of spaces and including the .md file extension  In the same way that we simplified updating Hugo front matter with a Bash script, we can use a script to make post creation even simpler as well.</description>

      <description>The Problem Hugo&amp;rsquo;s code fence syntax produced code blocks but didn&amp;rsquo;t produce code with syntax highlighting.
The Process A web search for syntax highlighting in Hugo returned some Hugo documentation pages:
 Syntax Highlighting Configure Markup: Highlight  While these offered some background information, they didn&amp;rsquo;t help resolve the issue.
 That search also returned this article, which provided an example for one solution of adding the following to the Hugo config.</description>

      <title>Automating Hugo Website Publishing Workflow with Bash</title>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/automating-hugo-website-publishing-with-bash/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Background We first need to define our terms.
Hugo already builds sites with one quick and easy command.
The automated website building this post refers to is several additional steps required for website publishing after that process in one particular workflow. Every person&amp;rsquo;s or team&amp;rsquo;s workflow for publishing a website is different. The workflow we&amp;rsquo;ll automate in this post includes the following:
 rebuilding a specific website with Hugo deleting all files and subdirectories in the website publishing directory except one specified file copying all files from the Hugo website project directory to the publishing directory  We&amp;rsquo;ll handle each step in turn and then bring them all together.</description>

      <title>Using the sed Command in a Bash Script to Update Hugo Front Matter</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</guid>
      <description>Background Hugo used to have an undraft command to quickly alter front matter before publishing, but it was removed.
The command would update &amp;ldquo;the content’s draft status from ‘True’ to ‘False’ and&amp;hellip; the date to the current date and time&amp;rdquo;.
That&amp;rsquo;s useful functionality, so we&amp;rsquo;ll replicate it with a Bash script.
For this project we&amp;rsquo;ll use sed, which is one of the basic programs that comes with most distributions of Linux and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for (among other things) replacing segments of text.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/hugo-site-looks-different-served-locally-vs-remotely/</guid>
      <description>The Problem When a new website layout generated with Hugo was pushed to production it rendered very differently on the web than it appeared locally.
It looked like the CSS was only partially applied and some elements overlapped one another.
The Process First, the source files were compared, but, as expected, they appeared identical.
Next, DevTools in the Chrome browser was used to compare a sample element on the site running locally vs remotely and showed that the sites were being styled by different CSS rules.</description>
