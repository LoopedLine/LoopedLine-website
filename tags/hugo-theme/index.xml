      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Specifically, this post is part of a project to build a contact form with Hugo and host it with Netlify.
Objective In a previous post we built a simple contact form. That form worked fine, but there were some elements of the user interface (UI) that weren&amp;rsquo;t optimal.</description>

      <title>Creating a Shared Partial File in a Hugo Project for Term and List Pages</title>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In a previous post we updated the list template so that it worked as intended for all sections and subsections.
The terms template, however, which generates pages like the tags page, used redundant code that still reflected the original interface.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll create a new list-page partial template file with the code from the previously updated list template.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In a previous post we built a new user interface for navigating between list pages. But the approach used in that post seems to go against the general Hugo structure for automatically creating list pages, so it introduced several problems.
Most strikingly, list pages for subsections always displayed a count for, and pointed to, the list page for all posts.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll override the CSS styling for certain HTML elements.
Since this project utilizes a Hugo theme that in turn utilizes Bootstrap, much of the styling for this site comes from Bootstrap. Consequently, to make changes to the CSS styling of this site, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to override some of the styles currently defined by Bootstrap.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll add a last modified date to post list pages in Hugo.
In a previous post we added a last modified date to post pages, now we&amp;rsquo;ll reflect that information on list pages as well.
Building the solution Since the information already exists on each post page, we just need to update the list layout to display it.</description>

This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll add a last modified date to posts in Hugo.
We already have a date field that reflects when a post was first published. We want to keep that date and conditionally add a new date that reflects when the post was last updated.</description>

It was replaced and superceded by the approach used in this post.
Update Note When this post was originally published, it linked to a dynamic version of the All Posts list page. That page has been retired. Consequently, links to that page have been replaced with a links to a saved static version of that page.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Consequently, nearly all design choices were initially made by the theme&amp;rsquo;s creator.
Naturally, when selecting a theme, you choose the one that best meets your goals. And the Minimal theme was chosen because it is clean and well-written.
But no theme is likely to match your project&amp;rsquo;s needs in every detail. As Zachary Wade Betz puts it:</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, after resolving the problem of Changing the Size of Font Awesome Icons in Hugo, we now want to increase the spacing between the arrow icons used for page navigation icons on list pages.
The Process From the previous investigation mentioned above we know that the arrow icons are defined in the fa-arrow-left and fa-arrow-right elements of the paginator.</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at changing the page navigation icons on list pages. For our purposes, the arrows used at the bottom of each list page are too small, making them difficult to click.
The Process As has been mentioned before, because Hugo offers so much flexibility and produces pages in such a layered way, it can be difficult to find the right place to make the necessary alterations.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
After working with Hugo for a while you might find that there are certain pieces of code that you include in every project.
Once you tire of manually copying and pasting them, it&amp;rsquo;s time to figure out which template file to alter to automatically include those snippets.</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
For this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the issue that when Hugo rendered a webpage from a markdown file it automatically converted text URLs to hyperlinks.
The Process A web search for how to disable automatic hyperlinking in Hugo led to a few discussions of the issue:</description>
