      <description>Introduction This project exists thanks to the incredible generosity of a tremendous number of people.
It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible to thank everyone who contributed. Acknowledgements are always incomplete.
Yet we want to make the attempt to express our gratitude.
Scope This project (in its current form) is now one year old.
We want to acknowledge the contributions of various companies, organizations, and groups that helped it reach this point.
While we might desire to be more granualar in our approbation, it would be both impractical in scope and imbalanced in outcome.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
In all our previous posts we worked with Git locally.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at using Git to work with remote repositories.
What is a remote repository? According to the &amp;ldquo;Git Basics - Working with Remotes&amp;rdquo; section from Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub:
 Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
In the previous post we looked at how to start working with Git as simply as possible. We did that by focusing on only Git, working with it only locally, and using only the most basic commands.
After installing and setting up Git, the commands we looked at were those for establishing a Git repository and completing the Version Control Cycle.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
In the previous post we looked at what Git and GitHub are, what problems they solve, and some key differences between them.
The goal of this post is to get you started working with Git as simply as possible.

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
Git and GitHub are two related but separate tools that are helpful for software development, as well as many other things.
They are both flexible and powerful, which makes them very useful.
But that flexibility and power come from some complex features and interactions that can also make them seem intimidating at first. They do not need to be intimitidating, however.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the start of a series on Git and GitHub.

Some users will utilize one set of features, while another group of users may focus on a fairly different set of features. Consequently, an efficient path for learning about Git and GitHub will depend on what you want to do with those tools and how you intend to use them.</description>
