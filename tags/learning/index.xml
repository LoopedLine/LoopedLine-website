      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to grow when you think you don&amp;rsquo;t need to.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to learn when you think you know enough already.
Growth, learning, advancement of any kind takes effort, resources, time.
You&amp;rsquo;re not likely to expend that effort unless you think you need to.
Learning requires the humility to recognize that you have something to learn.
You won&amp;rsquo;t learn until you try.
You won&amp;rsquo;t try unless you think you need to.</description>

      <description>Tempus Fugit  Some things are heard so often that we stop hearing them.
  Life is short. And just because that&amp;rsquo;s cliche doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less true.
&amp;ndash;Richie Norton
  There are many truths that sound like cliches, but they remain truths.
  Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.
&amp;ndash;Wayne Dyer
  We become insensitive to the reality of an idea because we hear it so much.</description>
