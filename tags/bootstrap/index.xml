      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Specifically, this post is part of a project to build a contact form with Hugo and host it with Netlify.
Objective In a previous post we built a simple contact form. That form worked fine, but there were some elements of the user interface (UI) that weren&amp;rsquo;t optimal.</description>

Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll build a simple prototype of the contact form we want to use for the project.
Even though form fields are a basic part of HTML they are strangely complicated to build.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll override the CSS styling for certain HTML elements.
Since this project utilizes a Hugo theme that in turn utilizes Bootstrap, much of the styling for this site comes from Bootstrap. Consequently, to make changes to the CSS styling of this site, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to override some of the styles currently defined by Bootstrap.</description>

It was replaced and superceded by the approach used in this post.
Update Note When this post was originally published, it linked to a dynamic version of the All Posts list page. That page has been retired. Consequently, links to that page have been replaced with a links to a saved static version of that page.</description>
