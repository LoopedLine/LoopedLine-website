      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll build a new user interface for navigating between list pages.
As of this writing, the list page has right and left arrows that allow navigating to the list pages for earlier and later posts. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep those, and add a count of the list pages to provide some context, as well as adding a link to the All Posts list page.</description>
