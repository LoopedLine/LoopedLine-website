      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to grow when you think you don&amp;rsquo;t need to.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to learn when you think you know enough already.

You&amp;rsquo;re not likely to expend that effort unless you think you need to.

You won&amp;rsquo;t learn until you try.
You won&amp;rsquo;t try unless you think you need to.</description>
