      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll override the CSS styling for certain HTML elements.
Since this project utilizes a Hugo theme that in turn utilizes Bootstrap, much of the styling for this site comes from Bootstrap. Consequently, to make changes to the CSS styling of this site, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to override some of the styles currently defined by Bootstrap.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective For this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll prototype a new user interface for navigating between list pages.
As of this writing, the list page has right and left arrows that allow navigating to the list pages for earlier and later posts. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep those, and add a count of the list pages to provide some context, as well as adding a link to the All Posts list page.</description>
