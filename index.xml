      <description>Confusion with rename There are several software packages with the name &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; available for Bash.
That can cause confusion if you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of the fact.
Adding to the confusion, on many distributions of Linux, like Debian and Ubuntu, the rename command doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to the &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; that is part of the util-linux package. Instead, it likely refers to a &amp;ldquo;perl-rename&amp;rdquo; package. To call the util-linux version you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have to use the rename.</description>

      <description>The Problem In Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) when running the command
sudo apt update the following error appears for every package
 &amp;ldquo;Temporary failure resolving &amp;lsquo;archive.ubuntu.com&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Introduction to Bash When you think of someone expertly working with a computer you might picture them stereotypically entering commands on a black screen with green text, the computer responding with rapidly scrolling walls of characters.
For a long time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize the thing they were typing in was called a shell. (The differences between a terminal, console, command line, and shell are nuanced. Many of the responses to this StackExchange question offer some helpful insight and perspective on the topic.</description>

      <description>The Problem When a new website layout generated with Hugo was pushed to production it rendered very differently on the web than it appeared locally.
It looked like the CSS was only partially applied and some elements overlapped one another.
The Process First, the source files were compared, but, as expected, they appeared identical.
Next, DevTools in the Chrome browser was used to compare a sample element on the site running locally vs remotely and showed that the sites were being styled by different CSS rules.</description>
