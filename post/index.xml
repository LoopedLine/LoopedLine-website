      <description>Introduction This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
Objective For this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll alter the user interface for navigating between list pages.
As of this writing, the list page has right and left arrows that allow navigating to the list pages for earlier and later posts. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep those, and add a count of the list pages to provide some context, as well as adding a link to the All Posts list page.</description>

      <description>The Challenge This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
For this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to build an automated list of all posts in the /project/content/post/ directory while leaving the existing paginator unaltered.
Hugo allows one list template per section, and since we want to keep the existing paginator, we need to find another way to automatically build that list.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/changing-a-hugo-theme-over-time/</guid>
      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Consequently, nearly all design choices were initially made by the theme&amp;rsquo;s creator.
Naturally, when selecting a theme, you choose the one that best meets your goals. And the Minimal theme was chosen because it is clean and well-written.
But no theme is likely to match your project&amp;rsquo;s needs in every detail. As Zachary Wade Betz puts it:</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, after resolving the problem of Changing the Size of Font Awesome Icons in Hugo, we now want to increase the spacing between the arrow icons used for page navigation icons on list pages.
The Process From the previous investigation mentioned above we know that the arrow icons are defined in the fa-arrow-left and fa-arrow-right elements of the paginator.</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at changing the page navigation icons on list pages. For our purposes, the arrows used at the bottom of each list page are too small, making them difficult to click.
The Process As has been mentioned before, because Hugo offers so much flexibility and produces pages in such a layered way, it can be difficult to find the right place to make the necessary alterations.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/regular-expression-syntax-highlighting/</guid>
      <description>The Problem When posting snippets of regular expression code inside code blocks (as in this example) it would be helpful to apply syntax highlighting.
Because this site uses Hugo, which uses Chroma, which does not yet include support for highlighting regular expressions another approach is required.
The Process A web search for regular expression syntax highlighting returned some discussions of the general question:
 Is there a good syntax highlighting hint for regular expressions?</description>

      <description>The Problem When authoring articles using Markdown that include Markdown special characters in the content, questions can come up about how to escape those special characters.
For instance, this article about updating Hugo posts with code syntax highlighting includes Markdown code fences within code fences, which required figuring out how to escape code fences within code fences.
The Process A web search quickly led to this helpful article, which explained the options for escaping code fencing.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
After working with Hugo for a while you might find that there are certain pieces of code that you include in every project.
Once you tire of manually copying and pasting them, it&amp;rsquo;s time to figure out which template file to alter to automatically include those snippets.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/simplifying-hugo-post-creation-with-a-bash-script/</guid>
      <description>Background Creating new posts in Hugo is already pretty simple thanks to the post creation command, but it can help to remove even little bits of friction.
Two points of friction in the current process are:
 navigating to the project directory, and properly formatting the new file name by remembering to name the file with dashes (-) instead of spaces and including the .md file extension  In the same way that we simplified updating Hugo front matter with a Bash script, we can use a script to make post creation even simpler as well.</description>

The Process A web search for syntax highlighting in Hugo returned some Hugo documentation pages:
 Syntax Highlighting Configure Markup: Highlight  While these offered some background information, they didn&amp;rsquo;t help resolve the issue.
 That search also returned this article, which provided an example for one solution of adding the following to the Hugo config.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/automating-hugo-website-publishing-with-bash/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Background We first need to define our terms.
Hugo already builds sites with one quick and easy command.
The automated website building this post refers to is several additional steps required for website publishing after that process in one particular workflow. Every person&amp;rsquo;s or team&amp;rsquo;s workflow for publishing a website is different. The workflow we&amp;rsquo;ll automate in this post includes the following:
 rebuilding a specific website with Hugo deleting all files and subdirectories in the website publishing directory except one specified file copying all files from the Hugo website project directory to the publishing directory  We&amp;rsquo;ll handle each step in turn and then bring them all together.</description>

      <title>Renaming Files with the rename Command (the Perl Version)</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/renaming-files-with-rename-command-the-perl-version/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/renaming-files-with-rename-command-the-perl-version/</guid>
      <description>Renaming files with the rename command Renaming files is a basic and mundane task.
Fortunately, there are several tools to make it easier.
The Perl version of rename available in Bash on many Linux distributions is especially powerful since it can utilize regular expressions.
Confirm which version(s) of rename you have available As previously mentioned there can be more than one version of the rename command on your system. So you&amp;rsquo;ll first want to confirm that you have the Perl version of rename installed and verify how the command is invoked on your system.</description>

      <title>Automating Bash Shell Commands</title>

      <description>Introduction to automating shell commands There is a lot that can be accomplished efficiently with Bash.
After getting started working with Bash you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly discover commands that you run again and again.
For some simple commands you can make them even more convenient by creating a shell alias or a shell function.
Other commands involving multiple steps you can typically use and manage more efficiently by creating a shell script.</description>

      <title>Creating a Directory with Bash to Test Commands</title>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/creating-a-directory-with-bash-to-test-commands/</guid>
      <description>Why create a test directory? When learning to work with new commands or programs it makes sense to be careful.
In particular, command line tools can be especially powerful. They can allow the user to delete or overwrite data before they realize what has happened. It makes sense to be careful, especially when learning how to use a command.
One way to partially limit that risk is to work in a test directory when trying new commands.</description>

      <description>Introduction When you want to create multiple files, Bash can help do it efficiently.
Below are several examples for creating files. To follow along, navigate to an empty folder where you want to create files and enter the commands.
A warning You may wish to remove files after each step, but since the rm command is powerful and can delete more files than you intended without prompting, make sure you understand its use before blindly applying the example commands below.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with the shuf Command in Bash</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-shuf-command-in-bash/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:57:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-shuf-command-in-bash/</guid>
      <description>There are many, many, ways to create (pseudo)-random strings in Bash, but I found this approach utilizing shuf to be the most understandable. Also, it gives excellent control over the output (avoiding whitespace and special characters) without resorting to the use of the tr command to remove unwanted characters. And it seems to be available for many systems without requiring installation of additional packages.
The shuf command When first learning about a command like shuf it is helpful to start be reading the tldr and info entries for the command.</description>

      <title>Using the sed Command in a Bash Script to Update Hugo Front Matter</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 11:37:37 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</guid>
      <description>Background Hugo used to have an undraft command to quickly alter front matter before publishing, but it was removed.
The command would update &amp;ldquo;the content’s draft status from ‘True’ to ‘False’ and&amp;hellip; the date to the current date and time&amp;rdquo;.
That&amp;rsquo;s useful functionality, so we&amp;rsquo;ll replicate it with a Bash script.
For this project we&amp;rsquo;ll use sed, which is one of the basic programs that comes with most distributions of Linux and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for (among other things) replacing segments of text.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-random-variable-in-bash/</guid>
      <description>Creating Randomness in Bash There are many shell variables used in Bash. One of them is the Bash variable $RANDOM.
$RANDOM returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 32767.
Try it by typing the following command into a Bash command line interpreter:
echo $RANDOM Run the command multiple times to see different results.
Changing the possible return range We can reduce the range of the output by using the modulo operator.</description>

      <description>Confusion with rename There are several software packages with the name &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; available for Bash.
That can cause confusion if you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of the fact.
Adding to the confusion, on many distributions of Linux, like Debian and Ubuntu, the rename command doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to the &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; that is part of the util-linux package. Instead, it likely refers to a &amp;ldquo;perl-rename&amp;rdquo; package. To call the util-linux version you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have to use the rename.</description>

      <description>The Problem When a new website layout generated with Hugo was pushed to production it rendered very differently on the web than it appeared locally.
It looked like the CSS was only partially applied and some elements overlapped one another.
The Process First, the source files were compared, but, as expected, they appeared identical.
Next, DevTools in the Chrome browser was used to compare a sample element on the site running locally vs remotely and showed that the sites were being styled by different CSS rules.</description>
