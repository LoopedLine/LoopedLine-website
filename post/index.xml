      <description>Introduction In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll create a Bash command for copying the directory structure of one directory into another directory using a Bash script - and we&amp;rsquo;ll use ChatGPT to generate the script.
ChatGPT Conversation  Our Prompt
Write a Bash command to recursively copy the directory structure of one directory to another directory.
ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s Response
 To recursively copy just the directory structure (without copying the actual files), you can use the `find` command in combination with `mkdir -p` and some text manipulation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Linux systems are made up of many components working together. And it may not always be clear to the user (especially a new user) what parts comprise their system.
If you have a question about what part was used for some portion of your system there are numerous fetches - tools for fetching system information - available for finding and printing system component information.
One popular option is neofetch.</description>

      <description>Introduction Deleting files is a basic function of using a computer. And on Linux, there is more than one way to delete things.
One of the tools, rm, comes standard but has some drawbacks.
Another tool, trash, does not come standard on most distributions, but provides some helpful protections.
We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss them both and take a brief look at how to use the trash tool.
Dangers of rm The command to delete files or directories that comes standard with nearly all Linux distributions is rm.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-the-tldr-command-in-bash/</guid>
      <description>Introduction tldr is a really helpful tool for the command line.
It displays short, simple help pages for command line tools, from the user-maintained tldr-pages project.
The tldr entries are shorter and more digestible than man pages, so it is great for learning about other commands.
It does not come installed on most Linux distributions, but on many it is easy to install.
You can also use tldr via the web app without installing it.</description>

      <title>Use Caution When Copying and Pasting to the Command Line</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/use-caution-when-copying-and-pasting-to-the-command-line/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/use-caution-when-copying-and-pasting-to-the-command-line/</guid>
      <description>An important note of caution Because Bash and the Linux shell are so powerful, you need to be cautious what commands you enter.
Running the wrong command (or the right command in the wrong place) can irretrievablly delete your personal data or allow your computer to be compromised.
Make sure you understand commands before you type them or copy and paste them to your machine.
As this article helpfully illustrates, you should not blindly copy and paste commands from the internet into your terminal.</description>

      <description>The Problem After setting up one Gmail account in Mozilla Thunderbird I experienced trouble adding additional Gmail accounts.
While trying to add a new account a new Gmail browser window would open and prompt for account name and password. Though there was no problem for the first account, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past this point for subsequent accounts.
It looked like the browser page just reloaded over and over again after about 10-20 seconds.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/adding-a-directory-shortcut-to-the-dash-panel-in-ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>Background Several Linux distributions use the GNOME desktop environment. For Ubuntu, which we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on here, this is true for the &amp;ldquo;vanilla&amp;rdquo; (i.e. the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo;) Ubuntu distribution, as well as several &amp;ldquo;flavors&amp;rdquo; of Ubuntu.
One of the main elements of the GNOME desktop is the dash panel or dash bar, which GNOME refers to as the dash: &amp;ldquo;The dash shows you your favorite and running applications.&amp;quot; (I think referring to it as &amp;ldquo;the dash&amp;rdquo; is a little cryptic to newcomers so in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it as the dash panel instead.</description>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-the-tree-command-in-bash/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The tree command is extremely useful.
According to the tree homepage:
 Tree is a recursive directory listing command that produces a depth indented listing of files
 In other words, tree displays a visual tree of the directory, it&amp;rsquo;s subdirectories, and all their content.
It is much faster and much more understandable than using cd and ls commands repeatedly to understand a directory structure and content.
It might best be understood by example.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a difference between know what and know how.
There&amp;rsquo;s a difference between knowing about a thing and knowing how to do a thing.
You can learn about cooking without ever really learning how to cook.
You can study music without being able to produce it.
Our language for each category is not always clear, but we often refer to know what as &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo; and know how as &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to grow when you think you don&amp;rsquo;t need to.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to learn when you think you know enough already.
Growth, learning, advancement of any kind takes effort, resources, time.
You&amp;rsquo;re not likely to expend that effort unless you think you need to.
Learning requires the humility to recognize that you have something to learn.
You won&amp;rsquo;t learn until you try.

It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible to thank everyone who contributed. Acknowledgements are always incomplete.
Yet we want to make the attempt to express our gratitude.
Scope This project (in its current form) is now one year old.
We want to acknowledge the contributions of various companies, organizations, and groups that helped it reach this point.
While we might desire to be more granualar in our approbation, it would be both impractical in scope and imbalanced in outcome.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
In the previous post we looked at what Git and GitHub are, what problems they solve, and some key differences between them.
The goal of this post is to get you started working with Git as simply as possible.
To keep things simple we&amp;rsquo;ll narrow our focus in this post in three ways:
  We&amp;rsquo;ll look at just Git - not GitHub.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is part of a series about Git and GitHub.
Git and GitHub are two related but separate tools that are helpful for software development, as well as many other things.
They are both flexible and powerful, which makes them very useful.
But that flexibility and power come from some complex features and interactions that can also make them seem intimidating at first. They do not need to be intimitidating, however.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the start of a series on Git and GitHub.
There are many uses for Git and GitHub so there&amp;rsquo;s isn&amp;rsquo;t one right path for learning about them. Some users will utilize one set of features, while another group of users may focus on a fairly different set of features. Consequently, an efficient path for learning about Git and GitHub will depend on what you want to do with those tools and how you intend to use them.</description>

Objective In a previous post we updated the list template so that it worked as intended for all sections and subsections.
The terms template, however, which generates pages like the tags page, used redundant code that still reflected the original interface.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll create a new list-page partial template file with the code from the previously updated list template.</description>

      <description>Introduction When testing changes to CSS it can sometimes appear that nothing is happening.
That can be caused by many issues, but one issue that can be tricky to detect is when the browser is caching old CSS after a reload of the page.
Even after the page is refreshed and the HTML content is updated, the old CSS styling can still linger. That can be particularly frustrating and confusing. If the page has refreshed, why hasn&amp;rsquo;t the styling updated?</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Currently, when new posts are created with the hugo new &amp;lt;file_name&amp;gt; command, a new file is created named with the file_name parameter passed to the command. With the help of the post archetype file, that filename is also used to create the post title.
That approach is fine for a small number of posts, but as the number of posts grows it becomes harder to find a specific post when looking, because files are sorted alphabetically by filename, which isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful in many cases.</description>

Building the solution We&amp;rsquo;ll build the persistent counter using two files
 a counter file that stores the next seqid a script that reads and increments the seqid  Creating the counter file Creating the counter file is very simple.
We&amp;rsquo;ll create a file named counter_next_test.txt with the Bash command:

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/fixing-site-link-errors-between-subdomains-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>The Problem Because of the design decision to build the website files for sites hosted on two subdomains within the same Hugo project there were several adjustments that had to be made.
One issue was that within a given subdomain links could be expressed as a relative path (/about/ or /post/, for instance), but across different subdomains that didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Specifically, on the page subdomain those links would point to page.</description>

      <description>Background This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
Consequently, nearly all design choices were initially made by the theme&amp;rsquo;s creator.
Naturally, when selecting a theme, you choose the one that best meets your goals. And the Minimal theme was chosen because it is clean and well-written.
But no theme is likely to match your project&amp;rsquo;s needs in every detail. As Zachary Wade Betz puts it:</description>

This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at changing the page navigation icons on list pages. For our purposes, the arrows used at the bottom of each list page are too small, making them difficult to click.
The Process As has been mentioned before, because Hugo offers so much flexibility and produces pages in such a layered way, it can be difficult to find the right place to make the necessary alterations.</description>

      <description>Background Creating new posts in Hugo is already pretty simple thanks to the post creation command, but it can help to remove even little bits of friction.
Two points of friction in the current process are:
 navigating to the project directory, and properly formatting the new file name by remembering to name the file with dashes (-) instead of spaces and including the .md file extension  In the same way that we simplified updating Hugo front matter with a Bash script, we can use a script to make post creation even simpler as well.</description>

      <description>Introduction Background We first need to define our terms.
Hugo already builds sites with one quick and easy command.
The automated website building this post refers to is several additional steps required for website publishing after that process in one particular workflow. Every person&amp;rsquo;s or team&amp;rsquo;s workflow for publishing a website is different. The workflow we&amp;rsquo;ll automate in this post includes the following:
 rebuilding a specific website with Hugo deleting all files and subdirectories in the website publishing directory except one specified file copying all files from the Hugo website project directory to the publishing directory  We&amp;rsquo;ll handle each step in turn and then bring them all together.</description>

      <title>Renaming Files with the rename Command (the Perl Version) in Bash</title>

      <description>Renaming files with the rename command Renaming files is a basic and mundane task.
Fortunately, there are several tools to make it easier.
The Perl version of rename available in Bash on many Linux distributions is especially powerful since it can utilize regular expressions.
Confirm which version(s) of rename you have available As previously mentioned there can be more than one version of the rename command on your system. So you&amp;rsquo;ll first want to confirm that you have the Perl version of rename installed and verify how the command is invoked on your system.</description>

      <title>Automating Bash Shell Commands</title>

      <description>Introduction to automating shell commands There is a lot that can be accomplished efficiently with Bash.
After getting started working with Bash you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly discover commands that you run again and again.
For some simple commands you can make them even more convenient by creating a shell alias or a shell function.
Other commands involving multiple steps you can typically use and manage more efficiently by creating a shell script.</description>

      <title>Creating a Directory with Bash to Test Commands</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/creating-a-directory-with-bash-to-test-commands/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/creating-a-directory-with-bash-to-test-commands/</guid>
      <description>Why create a test directory? When learning to work with new commands or programs it makes sense to be careful.
In particular, command line tools can be especially powerful. They can allow the user to delete or overwrite data before they realize what has happened. Often, these effects will be irreversible.
One way to partially limit that risk is to work in a test directory when trying new commands. The scope of a command&amp;rsquo;s effects is often (but not always) bounded within a directory, so this can provide some protection against unintended consequences.</description>

      <description>Introduction When you want to create multiple files, Bash can help do it efficiently.
Below are several examples for creating files. To follow along, navigate to an empty folder where you want to create files and enter the commands.
A warning You may wish to remove files after each step, but since the rm command is powerful and can delete more files than you intended without prompting, make sure you understand its use before blindly applying the example commands below.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with the shuf Command in Bash</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-shuf-command-in-bash/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/getting-started-with-shuf-command-in-bash/</guid>
      <description>Introduction There are many, many, ways to create (pseudo)-random strings in Bash, but I found this approach utilizing shuf to be the most understandable. Also, it gives excellent control over the output (avoiding whitespace and special characters) without resorting to the use of the tr command to remove unwanted characters. And it seems to be available for many systems without requiring installation of additional packages.
The shuf command When first learning about a command like shuf it is helpful to start by reading the tldr and info entries for the command.</description>

      <title>Using the sed Command in a Bash Script to Update Hugo Front Matter</title>
      <link>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</link>

      <guid>https://loopedline.com/post/using-sed-in-bash-script-to-update-hugo-front-matter/</guid>
      <description>Background Hugo used to have an undraft command to quickly alter front matter before publishing, but it was removed.
The command would update &amp;ldquo;the content’s draft status from ‘True’ to ‘False’ and&amp;hellip; the date to the current date and time&amp;rdquo;.
That&amp;rsquo;s useful functionality, so we&amp;rsquo;ll replicate it with a Bash script.
For this project we&amp;rsquo;ll use sed, which is one of the basic programs that comes with most distributions of Linux and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for (among other things) replacing segments of text.</description>

      <description>Creating Randomness in Bash There are many shell variables used in Bash. One of them is the Bash variable $RANDOM.
$RANDOM returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 32767.
Try it by typing the following command into a Bash command line interpreter:
echo $RANDOM Run the command multiple times to see different results.
Changing the possible return range We can reduce the range of the output by using the modulo operator.</description>

      <description>Confusion with rename There are several software packages with the name &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; available for Bash.
That can cause confusion if you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of the fact.
Adding to the confusion, on many distributions of Linux, like Debian and Ubuntu, the rename command doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to the &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; that is part of the util-linux package. Instead, it likely refers to a &amp;ldquo;perl-rename&amp;rdquo; package. To call the util-linux version you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have to use the rename.</description>

      <description>Series This is part a series about Bash and the Linux Shell.
In this first post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at what Bash is and what it&amp;rsquo;s useful for.
Introduction to Bash When you think of someone expertly working with a computer you might picture them stereotypically entering commands on a black screen with green text, the computer responding with rapidly scrolling walls of text.
For a long time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize the thing they were typing in was called a shell.</description>

      <description>The Problem This project is built with Hugo and uses the Minimal Hugo theme.
This post is part of an ongoing effort to tailor the theme over time.
For this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the issue that when Hugo rendered a webpage from a markdown file it automatically converted text URLs to hyperlinks.
The Process A web search for how to disable automatic hyperlinking in Hugo led to a few discussions of the issue:</description>

      <description>The Problem When a new website layout generated with Hugo was pushed to production it rendered very differently on the web than it appeared locally.
It looked like the CSS was only partially applied and some elements overlapped one another.
The Process First, the source files were compared, but, as expected, they appeared identical.
Next, DevTools in the Chrome browser was used to compare a sample element on the site running locally vs remotely and showed that the sites were being styled by different CSS rules.</description>
